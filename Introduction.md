<h1>Blog
<p1>This blog will document my journey of going from a fresh college graduate to a full time security proffessional.  I will post about different
excercises and learning techniques that I use to further my education and work towards being a successful security analyst or penetration
tester.  I hope this will be valuable in teaching others who will find themselves breaking into the security industry.</p1>
