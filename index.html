          <h1>Welcome to my Cyber Security Blog</h1>
    <p>My name is Stephen, I recently graduated from Penn State, and I am looking to become a security analyst or penetration tester in the near future.</p>
    <p>This blog will document Pen Testing Lab writeups and other learning techniques that I use to further my education and work towards being a successful security analyst or penetration tester. I will also post about popular vulnerabilities and tools. I hope that this page will be valuable in teaching others who will find themselves breaking into the security industry.</p>
