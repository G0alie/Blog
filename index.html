          <h1>Welcome to my cyber security page</h1>
    <p>My name is Stephen Gilchrist, I recently graduated from Penn State and am looking to become a security analyst or penetration tester soon.</p>
    <p>This is my blog that will document my journey of going from a fresh college graduate to a full time security proffessional. I will post CTF writeups, excercises, and learning techniques that I use to further my education and work towards being a successful security analyst or penetration tester. I will also post about popular vulnerabilities and tools. I hope this will be valuable in teaching others who will find themselves breaking into the security industry.</p>
