<h1>NMap and the TCP Handshake</h1>
<p>Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool to use after performing some reconnaissance on a target.  This post will go over some common scans and show just how they work by capturing and analyzing the scanning traffic in wireshark.</p>
<p> The first Nmap Scan we'll check out is the ping scan.  This is used for host discovery, to find which hosts are up in a certain network range.  The option for a ping scan in the most recent version of Nmap is <b>-sn</b>.  Here is the syntax for the ping scan I'll run.</p>
<blockquote>nmap -sn 10.10.10.</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to scan a range of only two IP addresses.  One host is down, one is up.  Here are the results of the scan.</p>

<p>Host 10.10.10.8 is up, we dont see anything about host 10.0.0.7, so it is down.  Let's see how it looks over the network.</p>

<p>Above, we see the ICMP pings in action.  The first two packets come from our ping sweep.  The ping sent to 10.10.10.8 says we got a reply in packet 9, while the ping sent to 10.10.10.7 says there is no response found.  In packet 9, we see the response from 10.10.10.8.  Since 10.10.10.8 responded, Nmap knows that the host with that IP is up. Since 10.10.10.7 didn't send a response, we know it is down.</p>
