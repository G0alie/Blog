  <h1>OpenVAS Intro</h1>
  <p>OpenVAS is a vulnerability scanning and management framework that originated as a fork of the Nessus vulnerability scanner, which is widely in use in the industry.  To show some basics of the tool, I'm going to use it on the HackTheBox Legacy machine that I did a writeup for <a href="/HackTheBox_Legacy.html">here</a>.  This will allow you to go back and see how I could have used openvas to scan the machine to find the same vulnerability that I exploited in the writeup.</p>
  <p>First, let's get OpenVAS set up if this is the first time runnin it on your Kali machine.  Enter the following two commands in the terminal.  The second command will take a while, so be patient.  When it is finished you will see the admin password displayed.  Keep that saved somewhere</p>
  <blockquote>apt install openvas<br>openvas-setup</blockquote>
  <p>Now that openvas is set up, type the following command to get started. Click the provided link to be taken to the web application</p>
  <blockquote>openvas-start</blockquote>
  <p>Hover over the configuration tab and select Targets.  In the top left corner of the page, you'll see a question mark and a star.  The question mark is on each page and will provide all the info on various aspects and symbols found on the page.  To create a new target, select the star.</p>

  <p>Enter the information on the target such as the name and the target IP address</p>

  <p>Now, let's star the scan.</p>
