  <h1>OpenVAS Intro</h1>
  <p>OpenVAS is a vulnerability scanning and management framework that originated as a fork of the Nessus vulnerability scanner widely in use in the industry.  To show some basics of the tool, I'm going to use it on the HackTheBox Legacy machine that I did a writeup for <a href="../HackTheBox_Legacy.html">here</a>.  This will allow you to go back and see how I could have used openvas to scan the machine to find the same vulnerability that I exploited in the writeup.</p>
